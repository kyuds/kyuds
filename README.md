### ðŸ‘‹  Hey! I'm Daniel Shin

Currently I am a Software Engineer at Everspin, a South Korean cybersecurity company, where I focus on web and android security. I am also an undergraduate student (on leave) at the University of California, Berkeley, expected to return spring 2026, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). 

I am broadly interested in distributed systems, security, machine learning infrastructure, and startups.
