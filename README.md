### ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Daniel Shin

Currently I am a Software Engineer at Everspin, a South Korean cybersecurity company, where I focus on web and android security. I am also an undergraduate student (on leave) at the University of California, Berkeley, expected to return spring 2026. 

I am broadly interested in distributed systems, security, machine learning infrastructure, and start ups. 

While back at Berkeley, I was an undergraduate researcher @ Berkeley SkyLab:
- Disaggregated memory on Ray
- Dataset distribution shifts

I am also involved in research with a group called AIIT:
- Improved prompting methods for logical tasks

Before those, I was an intern at Cartly:
- Backend infrastructure for online transactions
- Accepted to Berkeley SkyDeck, an incubator
