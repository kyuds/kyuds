### ðŸ‘‹  Hey! I'm Daniel Shin

Currently I am a Software Engineer at Everspin, a South Korean cybersecurity company, where I focus on web and android security. I am also an undergraduate student (on leave) at the University of California, Berkeley, expected to return spring 2026, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). 

I am broadly interested in distributed systems, security, machine learning infrastructure, and start ups. 

Apart from work, I am working on various side projects that pique my interest. Most of these projects are me trying to learn new technology (eg: TLA+), or reimplementing famous systems from academic papers I've read (Chord, Raft). If you are interested, please take a look. Any feedback is very much appreciated. 

While back at Berkeley, I was an undergraduate researcher @ Berkeley SkyLab:
- Disaggregated memory on Ray
- Dataset distribution shifts

I was also an intern at Cartly (Berkeley Skydeck):
- Backend infrastructure for online transactions
- Accepted to Berkeley SkyDeck, an incubator
